Node Bootstrap
==============

Inspired by Rob Righter's Node Boilerplate Version 2
----------------------------------------------------

A boilerplate project tailored to my own preferences. Comes pre-configured with Stylus, Coffeescript, and Jade as dev dependencies and integrates Twitter Bootstrap with the latest versions of Node, Express, Socket.io.

To start a project:
    
    git clone https://github.com/carlodicelico/node-bootstrap.git mynewproject
    cd mynewproject
    ./initproject.sh
This will set up a new Express project with Stylus and sessions support, integrate Twitter Bootstrap, and initialize a git repo for you. 

Make whatever changes you want to the project and set up your Makefile the way you like it. I've included stubs for watch, test, and build. Once that's done, you can do an initial build and run the app using `npm start`.
